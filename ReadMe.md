# Simple To-Do Application in Python

This Python code creates a simple customizable Pop-Up window for a To-Do list.

## Overview

First, we will need to use an appropriate package for this task. We will use **Tkinter**, which is a Python interface for creating **Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)**. A GUI provides an interactive window interface, allowing users to interact with the application through graphical elements instead of text-based commands.

## Importing Libraries

From the Tkinter package, we will import `messagebox`, which provides a pop-up window for displaying warning messages.

## Class Definition

Next, we will define the class for our application: `class ToDoApp`.

## Initialization Process

The body of the code will include the initialization process for the To-Do application, implemented in the `__init__` method.
